# Adrian's Second Brain

Welcome to my blog! As a software developer, I have often encountered a common sentiment in our industry that 
developers shy away from writing documentation.
Writing documentation can indeed be a chore but documentation is an invaluable tool for sharing knowledge
and fostering collaboration.

In this space, I aim to bridge that gap by capturing the insights and lessons I have gathered throughout
my journey as a developer. Here, you will find a collection of articles.
My hope is that these writings will not only resonate with fellow developers but also provide practical benefits
to anyone interested in the tech world.

Happy reading!
